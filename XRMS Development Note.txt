List of Issue must to be fixed later
1. Add id of user that create order (temporarily: set CreatorId = 1)
2. Table status list not update after refresh list
3. Insert event: need information of user do action (temporarily use CreatorUser that create order)
4. Insert 2 event before commit get error (in OrderManager.Update, because event repository can not get last
event counter of unsaved event) (temporarily solution: use 2 commit, each of them for inserting one event)
5. Unit of work use in-memory data when access database, so it make some data not update although database is affected
6. Use code block using for creating DbContext and make query inside, but error DbContext has been disposed, can not complete
the operation
7. OrderCashier screen refresh lost order item of selected order
8. Create SystemUser for entire program (later need create login window to read SystemUser)
9. Problem with lock order, try to make it run (modify it later for better)
10. FilterTextBox break MVVM model, View include namespace of Models (fix later)
11. Add label show how many order item was cancelled next by CheckBox Show Cancelled Product
12. Screen edit order: isDirty of each item problem, not update to false when user edit back to original data.
-> Fix: modify clsa framework (function MarkDirty(bool suppress) not notify property IsDirty)
-> This is not good solution beacause need keep csla framework stable.
13. Define which properties need use csla framework (managed properties), which need use normal property. (Now all properties use csla)
14. Cashier Screen: Execute select DiscountPercent when user select another item. (It save data, actually no need this step in this situation)
15. Modify keypad layout later.
16. Open order, order is lock, but when closing order popup using close window button, order is not unlocked. Please check.
17. Check login screen: view + viewmodel. Modify later, now just try to make it run.
18. ViewAwareStatusService_ViewLoaded in MainViewModel can not load CashierOrdersView at startup. Add this view into constructor method.
19. Add logout button, it will come back login screen.
20. Login screen can not use, exclude it from project, fix later.
21. xaml designer need connection string of ef
22. Change view of screen for kitchen.
23. Can not show popup in mainwindow.
24. Review Software:
- Add icon for tab header of each view.
- OrderView:
	+ disable Save button if users don't select table or no have any order item or all order items are cancelled
	or one of order item has quantity < 0. Create validation textbox of column Updated Quantity.
	+ Add editbox for column: Edited and Updated Quantity.
	+ Add button Serve
	+ Refresh OrderItem list every 5s (get message from MainWindow), check state of each item: if it has just been change
	by kitchen, devide editting item to old quantity and add new item.
	+ Just can modify OrderItem with state Ordered.
- Order Model: add business rule, table it must be greater 0.
- OrderItem Model: add business rule quantity must be greater 0.
- Check which property need to be managed by framework csla.
